        <title>How we built a distributed, self-funded, family-friendly, profitable startup</title>
                
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We started Gruntwork in 2016 with two goals: (1) make it 10x easier to understand, build, and deploy software and (2) 
build a company where we can work on interesting projects, with interesting people, while leading interesting lives. 
This blog post is primarily going to focus on how we’re trying to accomplish #2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how we built a startup that is distributed, self-funded, family-friendly, and profitable:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reusable, composable, battle-tested Terraform modules</title>
                
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Listen up, developers. You are not special. Your infrastructure is not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You have the 
same tech debt as everyone else. So why are you reinventing the wheel? Why are you building the same infrastructure, 
from scratch, over and over again?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Truth About Startups</title>
                
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m happy to share the video and slides of a talk I gave at the MIT Martin Center for Entrepreneurship, as well
as the Trinity College Blackstone Launchpad. It’s a talk I wish someone gave me when I was in college to help me think 
about the role of entrepreneurship and startups in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just published a blog post on the O’Reilly Radar called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oreilly.com/learning/why-use-terraform&quot;&gt;Why Use Terraform?&lt;/a&gt; where I discuss
what Terraform does and how it compares to Chef, Puppet, Ansible, CloudFormation, and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devrant.io/&quot;&gt;devRant&lt;/a&gt; is a place you can talk (or rant) about your life as a programmer with other 
programmers. The devRant folks are also putting together a series of podcast interviews. The first episode was with 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devrant.io/podcasts/episode-0-andy-hunt&quot;&gt;Andy Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Pragmmatic Programmer&lt;/em&gt; and one of the 
founders of the Agile movement. The second episode was with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devrant.io/podcasts/episode-1-david-heinemeier-hansson-dhh&quot;&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson&lt;/a&gt; (DHH), creator of 
Ruby on Rails and co-founder of BaseCamp. And the third episode was with me!&lt;/p&gt;
